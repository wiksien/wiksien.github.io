## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Custom fonts
- Love and care

### What I learned

I refreshened my knowledge about HTML and CSS, especially using SASS. I learned how custom fonts work and how to apply them in my websites. I improved my workflow within my IDE, Visual Studio Code.

### Continued development

In my future projects I defenetly want to take more care in naming SASS variables more accordingly and also seprate them into a different file to improve code readability. I would also like to explore using custom fonts in my projects more, I think they give a lot of personality to the website. Finally, I would like to include more JS into my future projects.

### Useful resources

- [A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me to quickly get information about what I need to do in order to complete a particular task using Flexbox. Great source of knowledge, I love how every property has a nice graphic to show what it does.
- [A Complete Guide to Grid ](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This helped me in the same way as Complete Guide to Flexbox, but with grid. Great source.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This helped me to get information about little stuff I forgot like shorthands ect. Another great source, I really like the this documentation is written, it is very understandable and makes all the specyfic information I need easly accessible.
